            <p class="pt-2"><b>Of reflection, refraction and transformation, memory and identity - a virtual
			exhibition at Prism by Myoung Nam Kim.</b></p>
            <p>Myoung-Nam Kim’s <i>Writing in white,</i> is a deeply meditative experience that examines multiple layers in the process of creation, from careful overall observation to the type of material chosen and the inclusion of tacit records like lines and punctuation marks, generated by the protrusion of paper to format visually striking landscapes. Working primarily with <i>hanji</i> and Korean ink, there is in Myoung Nam's work both stillness and restraint through which there pulsates a certain captivating rhythm and powerful energy. The resultant artwork created is, as the art critic Philippe Piguet, eloquently states, ‘an immaculately pure and peaceful spiritual landscape that blocks the visual verbiage of our times, leading us to an extraordinarily meditative space, an indescribable place of isolation. As a poet once lyrically stated, that place is ‘filled with order, beauty, luxury, peace and sensuality’.</p>
            <p class="pt-1">While physical doors of gallery spaces remain closed, virtual doors have opened.
			Following the opening of <i>Prism,</i> InKo Centre's virtual gallery, we are delighted to present <i>Writing in white,</i> a specially commissioned virtual exhibition by Korean artist, Myoung Nam Kim who creates unique artworks that exude both stillness and pulsating energy, harmoniously combining the versatility of <i>hanji</i> and the fluidity of Korean ink.</p>
            <p class="pt-1">Comprising a virtual walkthrough, a film about the artist's work process and a
			comprehensive list of relevant artworks, the exhibition invites you on a journey of discovery of the aesthetic beauty of Korean <i>hanji</i> and ink.</p>
           
            <h2 class="pb-3 pt-3">In the words of the artist, Myoung Nam Kim:</h2>  
			<!--<p class="pt-1">My "Writings in white" do not need a lot of explanation because my language is similar to a daily silent contemplation. What could I explain? I hope that, when looking at my works, and even as I cannot really reproduce the sounds I heard when working, one can "read" these words and feel these sounds. On the other hand, the variable lights lead to many different feelings but , if there is empathy and communication, nothing more can be desired. These works of paper will one day return to nature.</p>-->
           <p class="pt-1">I mainly work with <i>hanji</i> and with Korean ink. For my exhibition Writing in white, I made traces and perforations with tools and sewed together the different parts with white thread.</p>
            <p class="pt-1">To me, <i>Hanji</i> represents the Earth and the hardiness, sensitivity and subtle
			thinking of one’s spirit. This translucent paper symbolises meekness with the power to uplift!</p>
           	<p class="pt-1">With Korean ink, I can paint my interior scenery which naturally comes out of my
			memories. I tell my story in this way in my "Writing in white" artworks. Then, my brush full of ink dances on <i>Hanji,</i> producing rhythm, harmony and nuance. The Ink shades that are like the Earth and the white and translucent <i>Hanji</i> paper, which is like the huge misty skies are the language of my poetic landscapes that invite spectators to enter into a dialogue with the drawing and the words.</p>
            <p class="pt-1"><i>Hanji</i> and Korean ink are my roots and thanks to this firm grounding, I am stand upright and stay upbeat, always!</p>
            <p class="pt-1">After being diagnosed with glaucoma, I stopped painting with colours. However, I often strongly feel like painting the way I did in the past! I find that I need to go back to the times when I draw with Korean ink, a practice that I have fondly nurtured since childhood when I learnt Korean and Chinese calligraphy and Sumukhwa or Ink wash painting that uses black ink and monochromatic tones
			with great emphasis on virtuoso brushwork to convey the perceived "spirit" or "essence" of a subject.</p>
          	<p class="pt-1">My exhibition <i>Writing in white,</i> does not need a lot of explanation because my language is similar to a daily bout of silent contemplation. What can I explain? I hope that, when looking at my works, and even as I cannot really reproduce the sounds I heard when working, one can "read" these words and feel these sounds.</p>
            <p class="pt-1">On the other hand, the variable lights lead to many different feelings but, if there is empathy and communication, nothing more can be desired. These works of paper too will one day return to Nature...</p>
